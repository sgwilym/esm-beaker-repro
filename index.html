    <h1>Reproducing an issue with ESM in Beaker</h1>
    <p>Have a look at the console. I get:</p>
    <pre>
Failed to load module script: The server responded with a non-JavaScript MIME type of "text/html". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.</pre
    >
    <p>
      Could this be happening because the module being imported is local, so it
      is being served from my filesystem?
